1. Introduction
Face recognition technology simplifies attendance management by automating identification and record-keeping. Google Teachable Machine provides an accessible platform for training face recognition models, enabling easy implementation of such systems.

2. Building the Model
Data Collection: Gather images of individuals, ensuring diversity in lighting and poses.
Model Training: Import images into Teachable Machine, label classes (e.g., names), and train the model.
Testing: Validate the model with unseen images and optimize for accuracy.
Export and Deployment: Export the trained model (e.g., TensorFlow.js) and integrate it into an application.

3. Attendance System Workflow
Use the model to recognize faces in real-time or uploaded images.
Record attendance by logging recognized names with timestamps.
Generate and display attendance lists.

4. Attendance System Workflow
Face Detection: Use the model to identify individuals in real-time or from uploaded images.
Attendance Recording: Once an individual is recognized, their name and timestamp are recorded in an attendance database.
Display Attendance List: Generate a table or CSV file showing the attendance for a specific date.
